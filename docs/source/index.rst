Welcome to AI-MARRVEL documentation!
===================================

**AI-MARRVEL (AIM)** is an AI system for rare genetic disease diagnosis. 
It takes as input patient VCF and phenotype (formatted with HPO) to predict the causal variant(s), 
generating prediction score + confidence score as output.
It uses variant annotation from `MARRVEL <https://marrvel.org/>` database and more, to make the final decision.
