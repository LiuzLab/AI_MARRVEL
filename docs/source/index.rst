Welcome to AI-MARRVEL documentation!
===================================

**AI-MARRVEL (AIM)** is an AI system for rare genetic disease diagnosis.  
It takes as input patient VCF and phenotype (formatted with HPO) to predict the causal variant(s).   
In making prediction, it takes variant annotation from `MARRVEL <https://marrvel.org/>`_ database and more, 
and generates **prediction score** + **confidence score** as output.
